The history of the Warwick Valley is varied and full of surprises and treasures, and in many ways a mirror for the history of the eastern United States. Since time immemorial, residents have enjoyed its beauty and rich resources. A great wealth of artifacts and information about the history of Warwick has been preserved thanks to the efforts of interested individuals, newspapers, and the historical societies of the area: The Historical Society of the Town of Warwick; The New Milford Historical Society; the Drowned Lands Historical Society. Without their efforts much of what we know of its people and events of the past would be lost forever.
